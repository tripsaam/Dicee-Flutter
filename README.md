# Dicee ðŸŽ²

## Our Goal

The objective of this project is to introduce to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps weâ€™ll build in the future. This app will teach how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What I will create

Weâ€™re going to make a Las Vegas dice app. We can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in our pocket, weâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!

## What I will learn

- How to use Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
- How to use Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.
- How to change the properties of various widgets.
- How to use onClick listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
- How to use setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
- How to use expanded to make widgets adapt to screen dimensions.
- Understand and use string interpolation.
- Learn about basic dart programming concepts such as data types and functions.
- Code and use gesture controls.
